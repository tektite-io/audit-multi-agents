# audit

An 8-stage vulnerability-discovery agent, driven by your **Claude Pro / Max
subscription** through the official Claude Code Agent SDK. Many narrow agents,
deliberate disagreement, and an explicit reachability gate.

MIT-licensed. No API key needed if you already use `claude login`.

## Origin

This project is a from-scratch reimplementation of the pipeline described in
Cloudflare's [Project Glasswing](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cyber-frontier-models/)
post, which tested Anthropic's Mythos preview LLM against Cloudflare's own
codebase. The blog argues that real-world vulnerability discovery does **not**
come from asking one big model "find bugs here" — it comes from:

1. **Many narrow agents** working in parallel on tightly-scoped questions
   ("Look for command injection in this specific function, with this trust
   boundary above it") rather than one exhaustive agent.
2. **Deliberate disagreement** — a second agent, on a different model, that
   tries to *disprove* the first agent's findings.
3. **A reachability trace** as the gating step — most "is this code buggy?"
   findings are noise unless an attacker-controlled input can actually reach
   the sink from outside the system.
4. **A feedback loop** so reachable bugs in one place automatically seed
   hunts for the same pattern elsewhere.

This repo packages that pipeline into a runnable agent. The Cloudflare post
showed the architecture; this codebase ships the prompts, schemas, state
store, and orchestrator.

## The 8 stages

| # | Stage    | Default model | Purpose |
|---|----------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | Recon    | Opus 4.7  | Map the repo, emit narrowly-scoped Hunt tasks |
| 2 | Hunt     | Sonnet 4.6 | One attack class per agent; compile/run PoCs |
| 3 | Validate | Opus 4.7  | Adversarial re-read; tries to **disprove** (different model from Hunt) |
| 4 | Gapfill  | Sonnet 4.6 | Re-queue under-covered areas |
| 5 | Dedupe   | Sonnet 4.6 | Cluster findings by root cause |
| 6 | Trace    | Opus 4.7  | Prove attacker-controlled input reaches the sink |
| 7 | Feedback | Sonnet 4.6 | Turn reachable traces into new Hunt tasks |
| 8 | Report   | Sonnet 4.6 | Schema-validated structured report |

Each stage is one markdown prompt in `prompts/` + one JSON Schema in
`schemas/`. The orchestrator passes the schema into the system prompt so
every output is shape-stable on the first try.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Install
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# 2. Auth (pick one)
#    (a) Already logged in via claude login? You're done.
#    (b) Or generate a 1-year OAuth token for CI / non-interactive use:
claude setup-token
echo "CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=<paste>" > .env

# 3. Verify
audit auth-check

# 4. Run
audit run --repo /path/to/target --run-id my-run
audit status --run-id my-run
audit report --run-id my-run --format md > report.md
```

The agent uses **subscription billing** via your Claude.ai login — it does
**not** call the metered API. The on-disk auth module scrubs
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the environment so it can't silently route around
the OAuth flow.

## Cost containment

A real production codebase can produce 15-50 Hunt tasks and 25+ findings to
validate. At default concurrency this gets expensive. Flags to keep it sane:

```bash
audit run --repo /path/to/target \
  --max-concurrency 1 \           # one claude subprocess at a time
  --max-recon-tasks 15 \          # cap initial Hunt fanout
  --max-cost-usd 30               # abort cleanly if exceeded
```

The budget guard fires between *and* within stages — a per-task check in
Hunt cooperatively aborts rather than running 30 more tasks past the cap.

## Live-target reproduction (optional)

If the target has a running deployment, point the agents at it. Hunt now
**reproduces** each finding against the live service instead of compiling
a local PoC, Validate **rejects** findings that don't reproduce, and Trace
**confirms** reachability with real HTTP round-trips. The static path
remains available — these flags are opt-in.

```bash
audit run --repo /path/to/target --run-id live \
  --max-concurrency 1 --max-cost-usd 30 \
  --target-url http://server.local:8888 \
  --target-creds email=admin@system.com \
  --target-creds password=changechangeme
```

Rules the agents follow when `--target-url` is set:
- Network egress is restricted to that host + `127.0.0.1`. No other external
  hosts.
- A finding that doesn't reproduce against the live target is dropped or
  rejected (depending on stage) — "no fabrication".
- Credentials flow into every relevant stage's user_input as a dict.

## Scope notes (optional)

Targets often have intentionally-loose-by-design surfaces that aren't bugs
(e.g. plaintext API keys when that's a feature, test-only Mailpit endpoints,
anonymous-analytics ingest). Drop them in a text file and pass it in — the
notes are appended verbatim to every stage's user_input, and Recon / Hunt /
Validate honor exclusions you list.

```bash
audit run --repo /path/to/target --scope-notes target_scope.md
```

Example `target_scope.md`:

```markdown
- Mailpit (port 1025) is test-only; ignore.
- Plaintext API keys in the database are a required feature.
- Don't flag rate-limit absence on anonymous /ping endpoints.
- Only consider critical/high severity.
```

## Recon mines git history

Recon greps the git history for past security patches
(`CVE`, `sec:`, `fix.*auth`, `sanitize`, …) — patched files are hardened,
but **sibling files with the same idiom often aren't**. Findings get seeded
against the unpatched copies. Adds zero cost on repos without that pattern;
catches real cross-component bugs on repos that have it.

## Logic chains

The pipeline's default is one-attack-class-per-task (the Cloudflare paper's
narrow-scope rule). Recon can also emit `logic_chain` tasks for high-impact
multi-component paths (auth-bypass + IDOR + path-traversal that compose into
RCE, etc.) — one chain per task, with the `scope_hint` naming the specific
chain. This is the one allowed exception to single-attack-class scoping.

## Layout

```
prompts/        8 stage prompts (markdown, loaded as system prompts)
schemas/        9 JSON schemas — every agent output is validated
config/         stages.yaml — model + concurrency + tool allowlist per stage
audit/          Python package
  auth.py       OAuth check + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY scrubbing
  state.py      SQLite DAO (runs, tasks, findings, traces, dedupe, costs)
  runner.py     claude-agent-sdk wrapper with schema validation + repair turn
  orchestrator.py pipeline driver
  stages/       one module per stage
work/           per-Hunt-task scratch dirs (sandbox for PoC compile/run)
results/        JSONL artifacts per stage + final report.json
state.db        SQLite (gitignored)
```

## Safety

Hunt agents have Bash and run inside per-task scratch dirs. They are **not**
sandboxed at the OS level. Run the audit inside a disposable VM or container
when you don't trust the target source — a target with malicious build
scripts could otherwise execute on your host during PoC compilation.

The agent reads everything you `--add-dir`, including any `.env` or
`secrets/` directories in the target. Outputs land in `results/<run-id>/`
which is `.gitignore`d but **not** scrubbed of those reads.
